# Population One Win Rate Calculator
Simple NodeJS application that will tell you how many consecutive wins you have to get in order to reach a target win rate in the VR game Population One.  
More about the game here: http://www.populationonevr.com/

**The win rate calculator is currently hosted here: http://ok-studios.com/population-one-win-rate-calculator**

- [x] Caclulates win rate from games played and games won
- [x] Stores the input fields in cookies so the user don't have to input them every time
- [x] Big VR friendly buttons for registering wins and losses
- [ ] Store an array of wins and losses in a cookie to show history as a line of red and green dots, like [w] [l] [w] [w] [l] [w] [w] [w]  
- [ ] Integration with a Population One open API if one exist. None as of now :/
